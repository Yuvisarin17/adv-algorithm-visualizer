# Advanced Algorithm Visualizer

A React-based project to visualize advanced sorting and pathfinding algorithms.

- Sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- Pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* (A-star)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Interactive controls:
  - Adjust speed
  - Change array/grid size
  - Step through animations
  - Pause, reset, randomize

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- React.js
- HTML + CSS animations
- (Optional) Framer Motion or Canvas (for future improvements)

## ðŸ’¡ Project Goal

To build an educational visualizer that helps people understand how algorithms work through smooth, step-by-step animations.
